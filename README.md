# Jackal, A barely functional ripoff of Jekyll

This is a demo application for a Practicing Ruby article, it is not meant to be
used for anything real. However, it attempts to show how to do file and text
munging in a way that is similar to how Jekyll converts post source files into
HTML pages.

To try it out, do the following things:

1. Run `bundle` or manually install dependencies listed in the _Gemfile_
1. Take a look at the sample app in the _test/fixtures/sample_app_ folder
1. Run `ruby jackal_example.rb test/fixtures/sample_app/_posts sample_output`
1. Take a look at the generated files in the _sample_output_ folder
